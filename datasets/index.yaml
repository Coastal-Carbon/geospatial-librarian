# Geospatial Dataset Library — Tier 1 Index
# This file is loaded fully into the librarian agent's context.
# Each entry provides enough information for the agent to identify
# candidate datasets. Full profiles are in datasets/profiles/{id}.yaml

# GUIDELINES FOR NEW ENTRIES:
# - key_traits should describe CAPABILITIES, not list applications
# - Keep entries concise — detail goes in the full profile

datasets:

  - id: sentinel-2-l2a
    name: Sentinel-2 Level-2A Surface Reflectance
    type: raster
    modality: optical-multispectral
    resolution: "10m (visible/NIR), 20m (red edge/SWIR)"
    coverage: global land surfaces
    key_traits: |
      Distinguishes vegetation, water, bare soil, and built surfaces
      using 13 spectral bands from visible through SWIR. Sufficient
      resolution to identify features ~10m or larger (buildings, large
      parking lots, road networks, field boundaries). Multitemporal
      analysis possible with 5-day revisit. Atmospherically corrected
      (L2A). Free and open access. Red edge bands uniquely useful for
      vegetation characterization.

  - id: naip
    name: NAIP Aerial Imagery
    type: raster
    modality: optical-rgb-nir
    resolution: "0.6m"
    coverage: CONUS only (continental US)
    key_traits: |
      Highest-resolution free imagery for the US. Resolves individual
      cars, building footprints, driveways, swimming pools, tree crowns,
      and other features down to ~0.6m. Four bands (RGB + NIR) enable
      basic vegetation analysis at very high resolution. Leaf-on
      acquisition (growing season). Acquired every 1-3 years per state —
      snapshot imagery, not time series. US only.

  - id: osm-features
    name: OpenStreetMap Vector Features
    type: vector
    modality: crowdsourced-features
    resolution: feature-level
    coverage: global but variable completeness
    key_traits: |
      Pre-labeled vector features with semantic tags: buildings, parking
      lots, roads, land use, waterways, POIs, admin boundaries, and more.
      No image interpretation needed — features come with polygon
      boundaries and attribute metadata. Coverage is excellent in urban
      areas of US, Europe, Japan; sparse in rural and developing regions.
      Continuous community updates. Useful as-is or as training labels
      for ML models on satellite/aerial imagery.

  - id: landsat-8-9
    name: Landsat 8 & 9 Collection 2
    type: raster
    modality: optical-multispectral-thermal
    resolution: "30m (multispectral), 15m (pan), 100m (thermal)"
    coverage: global
    key_traits: |
      Similar spectral capability to Sentinel-2 but at 30m resolution,
      PLUS a thermal infrared band for surface temperature measurement
      and a panchromatic band at 15m. The Landsat archive extends back
      to 1972 — irreplaceable for long-term change analysis (decades of
      urbanization, deforestation, glacial retreat). Thermal band is
      unique among free satellites — enables urban heat island, fire,
      evapotranspiration, and water temperature analysis.

  - id: cop-dem
    name: Copernicus DEM (GLO-30)
    type: raster
    modality: elevation
    resolution: "30m"
    coverage: global
    key_traits: |
      Best free global elevation dataset. Digital Surface Model (includes
      buildings and tree canopy, not bare earth). Vertical accuracy ~2-4m
      in open terrain. Enables terrain analysis: slope, aspect, hillshade,
      drainage, viewshed, flood modeling, terrain classification.
      Static product (~2011-2015 acquisitions). Commonly used as
      ancillary input to land cover classification and habitat modeling.
