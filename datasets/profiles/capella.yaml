name: Capella Space SAR
provider: Capella Space

spatial:
  resolution: |
    ~1m (0.5m achievable in Spotlight mode). X-band SAR operating at
    ~9.65 GHz (~3.1 cm wavelength). Single-polarization HH is the
    dominant product in our collection (>98% of holdings).
  coverage: >
    Global (tasking-based). Coverage is not systematic — imagery is
    acquired on-demand via commercial tasking orders. Archive availability
    depends on what has been previously tasked. Dense coverage over
    areas of commercial interest; sparse or no coverage elsewhere.
  coordinate_system: UTM zones / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    On-demand tasking with sub-daily revisit capability (constellation
    of multiple satellites). Not a systematic repeat-pass sensor — each
    acquisition must be ordered. Rapid tasking available for time-sensitive
    needs.
  archive_start: "2020 (operational constellation)"
  latency: >
    Tasked acquisitions typically delivered within hours of collection.
    Archive imagery available immediately through STAC catalog.

strengths: |
  Very high resolution SAR (~1m) that operates completely independently
  of weather and lighting conditions. X-band radar penetrates clouds,
  rain, smoke, and haze, and works equally well day or night. This makes
  Capella invaluable when optical imagery is unavailable due to persistent
  cloud cover (tropical regions, maritime climates, disaster response
  during storms).

  The ~1m resolution is exceptional for SAR — sufficient to resolve
  individual buildings, infrastructure elements, ships, and large
  vehicles. X-band is particularly well-suited for urban and
  infrastructure monitoring because it scatters strongly off built
  structures, metal surfaces, and sharp geometric features. Double-bounce
  scattering from building walls makes urban structures highly visible.

  Rapid tasking capability means imagery can be acquired within hours
  for time-sensitive applications like disaster response, maritime
  domain awareness, or monitoring construction activity. The
  constellation's sub-daily revisit potential enables near-continuous
  monitoring when needed.

  SAR amplitude data enables coherent change detection, and the high
  resolution allows detection of relatively small changes in the built
  environment. When paired with optical data (Sentinel-2, SuperDove),
  provides a complementary view that captures structural and geometric
  properties that optical sensors miss.

limitations: |
  Commercial and expensive — every acquisition has a cost, so it is not
  practical for large-area systematic monitoring the way free sensors
  like Sentinel-1 are. Use Sentinel-1 for broad-area SAR needs and
  reserve Capella for targeted high-resolution requirements.

  Single polarization (HH) dominates our holdings, which limits some
  SAR applications. Dual-pol or quad-pol data (available from Sentinel-1
  or some Umbra products) is better for land cover classification,
  vegetation characterization, and polarimetric decomposition. HH alone
  cannot distinguish vegetation types or estimate biomass as effectively
  as multi-polarization data.

  SAR imagery requires specialized interpretation expertise. Unlike
  optical imagery, SAR backscatter is not intuitive — it represents
  surface roughness and dielectric properties, not reflectance. Radar
  shadow, layover, and foreshortening distort the geometry of the scene,
  especially in mountainous or urban terrain with tall structures.

  Speckle noise is inherent in all SAR imagery and must be filtered
  before most analyses. This filtering trades spatial resolution for
  radiometric accuracy, so the effective resolution after processing
  may be coarser than the native ~1m.

  X-band has limited penetration into vegetation canopy compared to
  longer-wavelength SAR (C-band Sentinel-1, L-band ALOS). It primarily
  interacts with the top of the canopy and is less useful for
  forest structure or biomass estimation than longer wavelengths.

preprocessing_notes: |
  Speckle filtering is essential before most analyses. Common filters
  include Lee, Frost, Gamma-MAP, or multi-looking. Choose filter
  parameters carefully — aggressive filtering smooths out fine details
  that the 1m resolution provides.

  Radiometric calibration: convert digital numbers to sigma-nought
  (backscatter coefficient) for quantitative analysis or comparison
  across scenes. Check metadata for calibration parameters.

  Terrain correction: in areas with significant topography, apply
  Range-Doppler terrain correction using a DEM (e.g., Copernicus DEM)
  to remove geometric distortions from foreshortening, layover, and
  shadow. This is critical for mountainous terrain.

  For change detection, ensure images are coregistered and acquired
  from similar viewing geometries (incidence angles). Different
  incidence angles produce different backscatter responses from the
  same target, confounding change analysis.

  When combining with optical imagery, reproject to a common CRS and
  resolution. SAR and optical data have fundamentally different pixel
  values (backscatter vs. reflectance), so they should be treated as
  complementary layers rather than directly compared.

  The data engine accesses Capella through CollectionName.CAPELLA with
  band ID 'HH' at 1.0m default resolution. The ObservationType for
  Capella in the data engine is CAPELLA_HH.
