id: naip
name: National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)
provider: USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA)

spatial:
  resolution: |
    0.6m (60cm) ground sample distance for most recent acquisitions
    (2018-present in many states). Older vintages may be 1m.
    Four spectral bands at the same resolution.
  coverage: >
    Continental United States (CONUS) only. Coverage includes all 50 states
    but Alaska and Hawaii acquisitions are less frequent. Does not cover
    US territories, and no international coverage whatsoever.
  coordinate_system: UTM / NAD83 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Historically acquired on a 3-year cycle per state (each state imaged
    once every 3 years on a rotating basis). More recent years have moved
    toward more frequent national coverage. Imagery is acquired during
    the agricultural growing season (leaf-on) — typically June through
    September depending on latitude.
  archive_start: "2003 (limited coverage); comprehensive national coverage from ~2010"
  latency: >
    Several months to over a year from acquisition to public release.
    NAIP is not a near-real-time product. Expect a vintage to become
    available 6-18 months after the flying season.

bands:
  - "Red (visible, ~630-690nm)"
  - "Green (visible, ~520-600nm)"
  - "Blue (visible, ~435-495nm)"
  - "NIR (near-infrared, ~760-900nm)"

formats:
  native: >
    MrSID (older) or JPEG2000/GeoTIFF compressed. Distributed as
    quarter-quad tiles (~3.75' x 3.75' area).
  common_conversions: >
    Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). Available as COG on most cloud
    platforms. For large areas, expect to mosaic many tiles.

access:
  method: >
    USDA Geospatial Data Gateway for direct download. Also available
    through commercial cloud platforms with much better query interfaces.
  auth: >
    Free, no registration required for direct USDA access.
    Cloud platform access may require platform account (free tier available).
  alternatives: >
    Google Earth Engine (as 'USDA/NAIP/DOQQ'). Microsoft Planetary Computer
    (STAC API, COG format — this is often the easiest access method).

strengths: |
  The highest-resolution free imagery available for the entire continental
  US. At 0.6m, you can clearly identify individual cars, building
  footprints, driveways, swimming pools, tree canopy structure, sidewalks,
  and other fine-scale features that are invisible at Sentinel-2's 10m
  resolution.

  The NIR band enables basic vegetation analysis (NDVI) at very high
  resolution, which is extremely useful for urban tree canopy mapping,
  precision agriculture at the field/plant scale, and distinguishing
  vegetated vs. impervious surfaces.

  Leaf-on acquisition timing means tree canopy and agricultural vegetation
  are fully visible, which is ideal for canopy cover analysis and crop
  type identification.

  As a standardized national program, the imagery is radiometrically
  consistent within a vintage and orthorectified, making it usable
  without additional geometric correction.

limitations: |
  CONUS only — no international coverage at all. This is a hard
  constraint for any project outside the United States.

  Infrequent temporal coverage (every 1-3 years per state) makes it
  unsuitable for time series analysis, change detection at fine temporal
  scales, or monitoring dynamic phenomena. You get snapshots, not movies.

  Leaf-on timing means bare-earth features under tree canopy are
  obscured. If you need to see ground under trees (e.g., forest floor
  features, structures under canopy), NAIP won't help.

  Only 4 bands (RGB + NIR) — no red edge, no SWIR, no thermal. This
  limits spectral analysis compared to Sentinel-2 or Landsat. You can
  compute NDVI but not more sophisticated vegetation indices like NDRE
  or moisture indices like NDMI.

  Large data volume — a single state at 0.6m resolution is tens to
  hundreds of gigabytes. Processing full states requires either cloud
  compute or significant local storage and processing capability.

  Release lag means you're always working with imagery that's at least
  6-18 months old. Not suitable for rapid response or current conditions.

preprocessing_notes: |
  NAIP imagery is already orthorectified and radiometrically consistent
  within a vintage, so no geometric or atmospheric correction is typically
  needed for single-vintage analysis.

  For large-area work, you'll need to mosaic many quarter-quad tiles.
  Using COG-formatted data from Planetary Computer or AWS with a STAC
  client avoids dealing with individual tile downloads.

  Cross-vintage comparison requires caution — different vintages may have
  different atmospheric conditions, sun angles, and vegetation states.
  NAIP is not atmospherically corrected, so absolute reflectance values
  are not directly comparable across vintages.

  The data is large. For any analysis covering more than a county-sized
  area, plan for cloud processing (GEE or similar) rather than local
  processing unless you have substantial compute resources.

  When working at 0.6m resolution, feature extraction methods that work
  at 10-30m (pixel-based classification) may not work well. Object-based
  image analysis (OBIA) or deep learning approaches tend to work better
  at very high resolution.
