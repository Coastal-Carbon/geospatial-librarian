name: Copernicus DEM (GLO-30 / GLO-90)
provider: European Space Agency (ESA) / Airbus Defence and Space

spatial:
  resolution: |
    GLO-30: 30m (~1 arc-second) posting — the standard free product.
    GLO-90: 90m (~3 arc-second) posting — lower resolution alternative.
    Both are Digital Surface Models (DSM), meaning they include the
    height of buildings, trees, and other surface features — not bare earth.
  coverage: >
    Global land surfaces. GLO-30 has full global coverage with a few
    small void areas filled from other sources. GLO-90 is available
    everywhere. Derived from the WorldDEM product based on TanDEM-X
    radar interferometry.
  coordinate_system: WGS84 / EGM2008 geoid (EPSG:4326 horizontal, EGM2008 vertical)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Static product — represents a single time period (approximately
    2011-2015 acquisitions). No temporal updates. Copernicus DEM
    releases are versioned but represent reprocessing improvements,
    not new temporal snapshots.
  archive_start: "2021 (first public release of GLO-30); source data from ~2011-2015"
  latency: N/A — static product with periodic version updates.

layers:
  - "DEM (elevation values in meters above EGM2008 geoid)"
  - "EDM (Editing Mask — indicates quality and source of each pixel)"
  - "FLM (Filling Mask — indicates void-filled areas)"
  - "HEM (Height Error Mask — per-pixel vertical accuracy estimate)"
  - "WBM (Water Body Mask)"

formats:
  native: GeoTIFF (1° x 1° tiles)
  common_conversions: >
    Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). Most cloud platforms serve it
    pre-tiled and cloud-optimized. Derivative products (slope, aspect,
    hillshade) are often pre-computed by platforms.

strengths: |
  The best free global elevation dataset currently available. Significantly
  better quality than SRTM (its predecessor) with fewer voids, less noise,
  and better accuracy in mountainous terrain and high-latitude regions.

  Vertical accuracy is typically 2-4m absolute (LE90) in open terrain,
  which is sufficient for most hydrological modeling, viewshed analysis,
  terrain classification, and slope-dependent applications.

  Being a DSM (including surface features like buildings and trees),
  it can provide information about canopy height and urban morphology
  when differenced with a bare-earth DEM, though this is approximate.

  Derivative products (slope, aspect, hillshade, curvature, roughness,
  topographic position index) are straightforward to compute and widely
  useful as ancillary layers in land cover classification, habitat
  modeling, and site suitability analysis.

  The Height Error Mask (HEM) provides per-pixel accuracy estimates,
  which is unusual and valuable for uncertainty-aware applications.

limitations: |
  Digital Surface Model, not Digital Terrain Model — in forested areas,
  the elevation represents canopy top, not ground surface. This can
  introduce errors of 10-30m in dense forest when bare-earth elevation
  is needed. For bare-earth DEM in forested areas, lidar-derived
  products are preferable (where available).

  30m posting means it cannot resolve terrain features smaller than
  roughly 30-60m. Individual buildings affect the DSM but their
  shapes are not resolved. For detailed urban terrain modeling or
  fine-scale hydrological routing, higher-resolution DEMs (lidar, or
  commercial stereo-derived) are necessary.

  Static product from ~2011-2015 — does not reflect terrain changes
  from mining, construction, landslides, or other surface modifications
  since then. Major construction projects (new reservoirs, large
  developments) will not be represented.

  Vertical datum is EGM2008 geoid, not ellipsoidal height. For
  applications requiring ellipsoidal heights (GPS integration, precise
  surveying), a geoid-ellipsoid separation correction is needed.

  Quality is lower over water bodies (which appear as flat surfaces
  at an approximate water level) and in areas with heavy radar shadow
  or layover in the original TanDEM-X acquisitions (steep mountain
  slopes, deep valleys).

preprocessing_notes: |
  For hydrological applications, the DSM nature means you should
  consider hydrological conditioning (filling sinks, breaching dams)
  before computing flow direction and accumulation. Standard tools:
  WhiteboxTools, SAGA GIS, or TauDEM.

  Derivative computation: slope, aspect, hillshade, and curvature can
  be computed with GDAL (gdaldem), QGIS, or any GIS platform. For
  large areas, cloud processing (GEE) avoids tile-edge artifacts.

  When mosaicking tiles, the 1° x 1° tiling means you'll need to merge
  tiles for most study areas. gdal_merge.py or gdalwarp handles this,
  or use a VRT (Virtual Raster) to avoid creating huge merged files.

  For integration with optical imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat),
  reproject to match the imagery CRS (typically UTM) rather than
  working in geographic coordinates. The elevation values in meters
  are preserved through reprojection.

  The EGM2008 vertical datum means elevation values are approximately
  "height above mean sea level." For precise vertical work, know that
  the geoid-ellipsoid separation can be 10-100m depending on location.
