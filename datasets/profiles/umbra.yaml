id: umbra
name: Umbra SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)
provider: Umbra

spatial:
  resolution: |
    ~1m ground sample distance (GSD) in standard imaging modes.
    Sub-meter resolution (down to 16cm) available in spotlight modes,
    though most archived imagery in Hum's collection is at ~1m.
    Single polarization (VV) dominates the archive (>98% of scenes).
  coverage: >
    Global coverage via tasking. Umbra operates a constellation of
    X-band SAR satellites that can image any point on Earth. However,
    this is a commercial tasking-based sensor — coverage depends on
    what has been ordered. There is no systematic global archive like
    Sentinel-1. Hum's STAC catalog contains only the scenes that have
    been procured for specific projects.
  coordinate_system: UTM zones / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Tasking-based — revisit depends on constellation size and tasking
    priority. The growing Umbra constellation supports sub-daily revisit
    capability for priority targets, but actual cadence for a given AOI
    depends entirely on tasking schedules and commercial agreements.
  archive_start: "2021 (first operational satellite launched December 2021)"
  latency: >
    Typically hours to days from acquisition to delivery, depending on
    the tasking agreement and processing level. Imagery in Hum's STAC
    catalog is available once ingested by the data team.

    Some open data samples are available through Umbra's Open Data
    Program. AWS Marketplace also offers Umbra data.

strengths: |
  Among the highest-resolution commercially available SAR imagery. While
  the standard archive resolution is ~1m, Umbra's spotlight modes can
  achieve sub-meter resolution down to 16cm — this is exceptional for SAR
  and enables detection of very small features such as individual vehicles,
  small vessels, and fine structural details on buildings and infrastructure.

  As SAR, Umbra imagery penetrates clouds and works equally well day or
  night. This makes it invaluable for monitoring areas with persistent
  cloud cover (tropics, maritime climates) where optical sensors like
  Sentinel-2 or Pleiades frequently fail to acquire usable imagery.

  The X-band wavelength (~3.1cm) is particularly sensitive to small-scale
  surface roughness and built structures, making it excellent for:
  - Infrastructure monitoring and change detection (new construction,
    damage assessment, structural deformation)
  - Maritime domain awareness (vessel detection, port activity monitoring)
  - Detailed urban mapping at a scale comparable to optical VHR sensors

  The very high resolution enables SAR-based change detection workflows
  that can identify subtle changes — new structures, ground disturbance,
  vehicle presence/absence — that would be invisible to the 10m resolution
  of Sentinel-1.

  In Hum's data engine, Umbra is registered as CollectionName.UMBRA with
  a single VV band (ObservationType.UMBRA_VV) at 1m resolution, making it
  straightforward to integrate into multi-source analysis pipelines
  alongside other commercial and open datasets.

limitations: |
  Commercial and expensive. Unlike Sentinel-1, Umbra data is not free or
  open — every scene in the archive was purchased. This limits the volume
  of data available and makes large-area systematic monitoring cost-
  prohibitive compared to free SAR alternatives.

  Single polarization only (VV). The archive is overwhelmingly VV-polarized
  (>98% of scenes). This limits the types of analysis possible compared to
  dual-pol (VV+VH) sensors like Sentinel-1. Specifically, you cannot
  compute cross-pol ratios (VV/VH) which are valuable for vegetation
  characterization, wetland mapping, and certain land cover classification
  approaches. The SOURCE_INFO definition includes HH, VH, and HV band IDs,
  but in practice these polarizations are rarely available.

  SAR data requires specialized expertise to interpret and process. Unlike
  optical imagery, SAR backscatter values are not intuitive — bright pixels
  mean high radar return (metal, corner reflectors, steep slopes facing the
  sensor), dark pixels mean smooth surfaces or radar shadow. Analysts
  unfamiliar with SAR will face a steep learning curve.

  Inherent SAR artifacts: speckle noise, layover (tall structures leaning
  toward the sensor), foreshortening (slopes compressed), and radar shadow
  (areas behind tall objects or steep terrain that receive no signal). These
  artifacts are more pronounced at higher resolution and in urban/mountainous
  terrain — precisely the areas where Umbra's high resolution is most
  valuable.

  No systematic global archive. Coverage is spotty and project-driven.
  You cannot assume imagery exists for an arbitrary location and time
  period the way you can with Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2.

  X-band has limited penetration into vegetation canopy compared to
  C-band (Sentinel-1) or L-band (ALOS PALSAR). For applications requiring
  canopy penetration (biomass estimation, under-canopy mapping), longer
  wavelength SAR is more appropriate.

preprocessing_notes: |
  SAR data requires different preprocessing than optical imagery. Key
  considerations:

  Speckle filtering: Raw SAR imagery contains multiplicative speckle
  noise. Apply a speckle filter (Lee, Frost, or Gamma MAP) before
  visual interpretation or pixel-based analysis. For deep learning
  workflows, some teams prefer to work with unfiltered data and let
  the model learn to handle speckle.

  Radiometric calibration: Ensure the data is calibrated to sigma-nought
  (backscatter coefficient) if you need physically meaningful values for
  comparison across dates or with other SAR sensors. Check the STAC item
  metadata for the processing level of each scene.

  Geometric terrain correction: In areas with significant topography,
  apply Range-Doppler terrain correction using a DEM (cop-dem is a good
  choice) to reduce geometric distortions from layover and foreshortening.

  Coordinate alignment: When combining Umbra with other datasets (e.g.,
  Sentinel-2 optical, Sentinel-1 SAR), verify spatial alignment carefully.
  Commercial SAR geolocation accuracy is generally good but may require
  fine co-registration for pixel-level fusion.

  Log-scale conversion: SAR backscatter values span several orders of
  magnitude. Converting to dB scale (10 * log10(value)) compresses the
  dynamic range and makes the imagery easier to visualize and analyze.

  In the data engine, Umbra data is accessed via CollectionName.UMBRA
  through the stac-fastapi catalog. The default band mapping uses only
  band index 0 (VV polarization), mapped to ObservationType.UMBRA_VV.
  Resolution defaults to 1.0m as defined in SOURCE_INFO.
