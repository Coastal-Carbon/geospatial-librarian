spatial:
  resolution: |
    10m global land cover classification derived from Sentinel-2 imagery.
    Single-band categorical raster — each pixel is assigned one of 9 land
    cover classes (plus No_Data and Clouds). All classes are at the same
    10m spatial resolution.
  coverage: >
    Global land surfaces. Full wall-to-wall coverage for each year in the
    archive (2017-2023). Coverage extends to all areas where Sentinel-2
    imagery is available, including most islands and coastal zones.
  coordinate_system: WGS84 (EPSG:4326)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Annual. One global map is produced per calendar year, representing
    the dominant land cover class for that year.
  archive_start: "2017"
  latency: >
    Annual release cycle. Each year's map is typically published several
    months after the end of the calendar year.

formats:

  common_conversions: >
    Typically consumed as-is (COG via STAC). For zonal summaries the Data
    Engine reads tiles via odc-stac and computes per-H3-cell statistics
    (majority class, unique class count, and optional histograms).

    Searchable by bounding box and date range. Tiles are served as
    Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs accessible via HTTP range requests.

strengths: |
  Annual temporal resolution is the defining advantage. Provides a
  consistent 10m global land cover map for every year from 2017 to 2023,
  enabling year-over-year land use change tracking. This temporal
  dimension is what distinguishes it from ESA WorldCover, which only
  provides snapshots for 2020 and 2021.

  Uses the same 9-class scheme as ESA WorldCover (Water, Trees,
  Flooded_vegetation, Crops, Built_area, Bare_ground, Snow_ice, Clouds,
  Rangeland), making the two datasets directly comparable and
  interchangeable for most classification workflows.

  10m resolution is sufficient to capture meaningful land cover patterns
  at the scale of individual fields, neighborhoods, and small water
  bodies. This makes it useful for site characterization, environmental
  impact assessment, and regional planning contexts.

  In the Data Engine, this dataset is the primary source for ancillary
  land cover context. For each H3 cell, the engine computes
  landcover_majority (the dominant class) and landcover_unique (number
  of distinct classes present), providing a compact land cover signature
  that can be used as features in downstream models or for stratified
  sampling.

  Free and openly available through Microsoft Planetary Computer with
  no authentication required.

limitations: |
  Classification accuracy varies by region and year. The product is
  derived from an automated deep learning classifier applied to
  Sentinel-2 composites, and accuracy is generally lower than
  manually validated products like ESA WorldCover for any single year.

  Inter-annual consistency is not guaranteed. The same location may be
  classified differently in adjacent years not because of actual land
  cover change but due to differences in input imagery quality, cloud
  contamination, or classifier behavior. Care is needed when
  interpreting year-over-year transitions — not all changes are real.

  The 9-class scheme is relatively coarse. It cannot distinguish crop
  types, forest types, or urban density gradations. For applications
  requiring finer thematic detail (e.g., separating rice paddies from
  wheat, or dense urban from suburban), a more detailed classification
  or custom model is needed.

  Cloud class (value 10) appears in some pixels, meaning the classifier
  could not determine the land cover. These pixels need to be handled
  (masked or gap-filled) in analysis workflows.

  10m resolution means sub-pixel features (narrow roads, individual
  buildings in sparse areas, narrow streams) may not be captured.

preprocessing_notes: |
  The data is categorical (uint8), not continuous. Standard raster
  operations like averaging or interpolation are NOT appropriate.
  Use mode (majority), counts, or histograms for spatial aggregation.

  When loading via odc-stac, set the nodata value to 0 (No_Data class)
  to properly mask missing data. The Data Engine does this automatically:
  data.rio.write_nodata(0, inplace=True).

  For change detection between years, load multiple years and compare
  pixel values directly. Be aware that some apparent changes may be
  classification artifacts rather than real land cover transitions.
  Consider requiring a change to persist for 2+ consecutive years
  before treating it as genuine.

  For integration with other raster datasets (Sentinel-2, DEM), reproject
  to match the target CRS. Since the data is categorical, use
  nearest-neighbor resampling to avoid creating invalid class values.

  The LandcoverCategory enum in the Data Engine maps pixel values to
  class names: No_Data=0, Water=1, Trees=2, Flooded_vegetation=4,
  Crops=5, Built_area=7, Bare_ground=8, Snow_ice=9, Clouds=10,
  Rangeland=11. Note the gaps in the numbering (no values 3 or 6).
