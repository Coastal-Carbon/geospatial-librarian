spatial:
  resolution: |
    10m global land cover classification. All classes are delivered at the
    same 10m resolution. This is the highest resolution free global land
    cover product currently available.
  coverage: >
    Global land surfaces (between 90N and 60S for v2021; full global for
    v2020). Based on Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery,
    processed using machine learning classifiers.

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Single-epoch product. v1.0 covers the year 2020, v2.0 covers 2021.
    Not a continuous time series — each version is a snapshot representing
    one calendar year.
  archive_start: "2020 (v1.0); 2021 (v2.0)"

strengths: |
  The highest resolution free global land cover product available at 10m,
  making it significantly more detailed than alternatives like GlobCover
  (300m) or MODIS land cover (500m). Only the IO LULC Annual product
  (also 10m, derived from ESA WorldCover methodology) offers comparable
  resolution with annual temporal coverage.

  Derived from both Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) data,
  which means the classification is more robust in persistently cloudy
  regions where optical-only products struggle. The SAR component helps
  distinguish water, urban, and forested areas even under cloud cover.

  Extremely useful as a contextual/ancillary layer for other analyses:
  stratifying sampling designs, masking irrelevant land cover types,
  providing prior class probabilities for custom classifiers, and
  generating landscape composition metrics within areas of interest.

  Consistent global methodology means cross-region comparisons are valid,
  unlike products assembled from heterogeneous regional maps.

limitations: |
  Classification errors exist, particularly at class boundaries and in
  transitional landscapes. Confusion between cropland and grassland,
  and between shrubland and sparse tree cover, is common. The overall
  reported accuracy is ~75% globally, but varies significantly by region
  and class.

  Single-epoch product (2020 and 2021 only) — it does not capture
  temporal land cover change. For change detection or multi-year
  analysis, the IO LULC Annual product (io-lulc-annual-v02) provides
  annual maps from 2017 onward using a related methodology.

  The 11-class legend is relatively coarse. It does not distinguish
  crop types, forest species, or urban density. For applications
  requiring finer thematic detail, custom classification using the
  underlying Sentinel imagery is necessary.

  Classification values represent a hard assignment — no class
  probability or confidence layer is provided with the product. The
  input quality layers (observation counts) can serve as a rough proxy
  for reliability.

preprocessing_notes: |
  Values are categorical integers — use nearest-neighbor resampling for
  any reprojection or rescaling. Bilinear or cubic interpolation will
  produce meaningless intermediate values.

  When using as an ancillary layer alongside Sentinel-2 or other
  imagery, reproject to match the target imagery CRS (typically UTM)
  rather than working in geographic coordinates.

  The Data Engine accesses ESA WorldCover via the 'esa-worldcover'
  collection on Microsoft Planetary Computer (CollectionName.ESA_WORLDCOVER).
  The primary band is 'map' (the classification layer). Three quality
  bands are also available: s1_observation_count, s2_observation_count,
  and invalid_s2_percentage.

  Note: The Data Engine ancillary landcover module
  (hum_ai.data_engine.ancillary.landcover) uses the IO LULC Annual
  product (io-lulc-annual-v02) rather than ESA WorldCover directly for
  H3-based zonal summaries. That module defines a LandcoverCategory enum
  with a different class scheme. ESA WorldCover is accessed directly via
  the STAC collection for pixel-level use in training data pipelines.
