spatial:
  resolution: |
    10m: VV (co-polarization) and VH (cross-polarization) backscatter channels
    Both channels are provided at the same 10m ground resolution.
  coverage: >
    Global land surfaces. Sentinel-1 operates in Interferometric Wide (IW)
    swath mode over land, covering a 250km swath. Near-global land coverage
    between approximately 84°N and 56°S. Some gaps exist in low-priority
    regions (open ocean, Antarctica interior). Coverage density is higher
    over Europe and other priority areas defined by ESA.
  coordinate_system: UTM zones / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    12-day exact repeat cycle per satellite. With both Sentinel-1A and 1C
    operating, effective revisit is 6 days. Over Europe and other priority
    areas, revisit can be as frequent as every 6 days from a single satellite
    due to overlapping orbits at higher latitudes.

    Common to convert to decibels (dB) via 10 * log10(value) for
    visualization and some analyses.

strengths: |
  SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is fundamentally different from optical
  imagery. It is an active sensor that transmits microwave pulses and
  measures the returned signal, which means it operates independent of
  sunlight (day and night) and sees through clouds, haze, and smoke.
  This makes Sentinel-1 the go-to dataset when cloud cover prevents
  optical observation — particularly in tropical regions, during monsoon
  seasons, and for rapid disaster response where waiting for clear skies
  is not an option.

  The C-band microwave signal (5.405 GHz, ~5.5cm wavelength) interacts
  with surface structure at the centimeter-to-meter scale. It is highly
  sensitive to surface roughness, dielectric properties (especially
  moisture content), and geometric structure of the surface. This makes
  it excellent for:

  - Flood mapping and monitoring: Water surfaces produce very low
    backscatter (they appear dark), making flooded areas easy to
    distinguish from surrounding land.
  - Soil moisture estimation: Backscatter intensity correlates with
    soil water content, particularly in bare or sparsely vegetated areas.
  - Change detection: SAR coherence and intensity changes reliably
    detect construction, deforestation, earthquake damage, and other
    surface modifications.
  - Ice and snow monitoring: SAR can distinguish wet snow, dry snow,
    and ice types based on their different backscatter signatures.
  - Crop monitoring: VH/VV ratio tracks vegetation growth stages
    through the growing season, even under persistent cloud cover.

  The dual-polarization (VV + VH) channels provide two complementary
  views of the surface. VV is more sensitive to surface roughness and
  soil moisture, while VH responds more to volume scattering from
  vegetation canopy structure.

  At 10m resolution, Sentinel-1 matches Sentinel-2's best bands and
  is free and open — making SAR-optical fusion straightforward.

limitations: |
  SAR data is fundamentally harder to interpret than optical imagery.
  There is no color or spectral information — you only have backscatter
  intensity in two polarization channels. Visual interpretation requires
  training and experience.

  Speckle noise is inherent in all coherent imaging systems like SAR.
  Individual pixels have a multiplicative noise pattern (salt-and-pepper
  appearance) that must be filtered before quantitative analysis. Common
  filters include Lee, Frost, and multi-temporal averaging, but all
  involve tradeoffs between noise reduction and spatial detail.

  Geometric distortions are a significant challenge in mountainous
  terrain. Foreshortening (slopes facing the sensor appear compressed),
  layover (steep slopes fold over onto themselves), and radar shadow
  (areas behind steep slopes receive no signal) all degrade data quality
  in rugged topography. The RTC processing corrects for radiometric
  effects of terrain but does not eliminate geometric distortions.

  C-band has limited penetration into dense vegetation canopy. In
  tropical forests, the signal primarily interacts with the canopy top
  and upper branches, not the ground surface. For biomass estimation
  in dense forests, L-band SAR (ALOS PALSAR, future NISAR) is preferred.

  SAR cannot provide information about surface material composition
  or color — there are no spectral indices equivalent to NDVI or NDWI
  from optical data. For vegetation health assessment or mineral mapping,
  SAR must be combined with optical data.

  Orbital geometry means the sensor always looks to the right at a
  fixed incidence angle range (~30-46 degrees for IW mode). Features
  look different depending on their orientation relative to the orbit
  direction (ascending vs. descending passes).

preprocessing_notes: |
  The RTC (Radiometric Terrain Corrected) product on Planetary Computer
  has already undergone significant preprocessing: thermal noise removal,
  radiometric calibration to gamma-nought, and terrain correction using
  the Copernicus DEM. This eliminates the most complex SAR preprocessing
  steps that would otherwise require specialized software (SNAP, ISCE).

  Values are provided in linear power scale (gamma-nought). For most
  visualization and many analyses, convert to decibels: dB = 10 * log10(value).
  Typical backscatter ranges in dB: water -20 to -25 dB, bare soil -10
  to -15 dB, vegetation -5 to -12 dB, urban 0 to -5 dB.

  The missing/no-data value in the Data Engine is -32768.0 (float32).
  Be sure to mask these before computing statistics or converting to dB
  (log of a negative number is undefined).

  Speckle filtering is NOT applied in the RTC product — you will need
  to apply your own if needed. For single-date analysis, a spatial filter
  (e.g., Lee filter with 5x5 or 7x7 window) is common. For time series,
  multi-temporal averaging or compositing is often more effective and
  preserves spatial detail better than spatial filtering.

  When combining with Sentinel-2, both are natively at 10m resolution,
  but ensure you are reprojecting to a common CRS and pixel grid. The
  Data Engine handles this alignment automatically through the
  CollectionInput configuration.

  SAR acquisition geometry matters: ascending (south-to-north, evening)
  and descending (north-to-south, morning) passes see terrain from
  different angles. For consistency, filter to one orbit direction if
  geometric effects are a concern for your application.
