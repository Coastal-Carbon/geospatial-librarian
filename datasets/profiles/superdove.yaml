id: superdove
name: Planet SuperDove (PSB.SD) 8-Band Surface Reflectance
provider: Planet Labs PBC

spatial:
  resolution: |
    All 8 bands at ~3m native GSD (ground sample distance).
    In Hum's internal STAC catalog, imagery is stored resampled to 1.0m.
    The native 3m GSD sits between Sentinel-2 (10m) and sub-meter VHR
    satellites like SkySat or Pleiades.
  coverage: >
    Global. The SuperDove constellation comprises 200+ satellites, providing
    near-daily imaging of the entire land surface. Oceanic and polar coverage
    is available but less frequent. Tasking is not required — the constellation
    operates in a continuous mapping mode.
  coordinate_system: UTM zones / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Near-daily global revisit. The 200+ satellite constellation enables
    multiple observations per day at most locations under clear skies.
    This is the highest-cadence commercial optical constellation available.
  archive_start: "2020 (SuperDove / PSB.SD generation); earlier Dove data back to 2016"
  latency: >
    Imagery is typically available within hours of acquisition through
    Planet's platform. Availability in Hum's internal STAC catalog depends
    on ingestion pipeline timing.

bands:
  - "Coastal Blue (~443nm, 3m) — water column penetration, atmospheric correction"
  - "Blue (~490nm, 3m) — water body mapping, atmospheric scattering"
  - "Green I (~531nm, 3m) — narrow green band, vegetation peak reflectance"
  - "Green (~565nm, 3m) — standard green channel, vegetation mapping"
  - "Yellow (~610nm, 3m) — vegetation stress, senescence detection"
  - "Red (~665nm, 3m) — chlorophyll absorption, core NDVI input"
  - "Red Edge (~705nm, 3m) — vegetation health, chlorophyll content estimation"
  - "Near-Infrared (~865nm, 3m) — vegetation structure, water boundary delineation"

formats:
  native: GeoTIFF (8-band analytic surface reflectance product)
  common_conversions: >
    Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). In Hum's STAC catalog, imagery is
    served as COGs resampled to 1.0m resolution.

strengths: |
  Unmatched temporal revisit for optical imagery. With 200+ satellites
  imaging the entire globe near-daily, SuperDove enables time series
  analysis at a cadence no other optical constellation can match. This
  makes it the go-to dataset for high-frequency change monitoring:
  construction progress, disaster response, crop phenology tracking,
  and any application where weekly-or-better observations are critical.

  The 8-band spectral configuration is unusually rich for a 3m-class
  sensor. The inclusion of coastal blue, yellow, and red edge bands —
  on top of standard blue, green, red, and NIR — enables advanced
  spectral indices and analyses typically only available at coarser
  resolutions (e.g., Sentinel-2 at 10-20m). The yellow band is
  particularly useful for detecting vegetation stress and senescence,
  while the red edge band is essential for chlorophyll content
  estimation and crop health monitoring. The second green band
  (Green I) provides a narrower spectral window around the vegetation
  reflectance peak.

  At ~3m, SuperDove resolves individual buildings, road segments,
  agricultural field boundaries, and land cover transitions at a
  scale that bridges the gap between Sentinel-2 (where a building
  is 1-2 pixels) and VHR sensors (sub-meter). This makes it
  excellent for regional-scale mapping at moderate-high resolution.

limitations: |
  Commercial data — requires a Planet license. This limits ad-hoc
  exploratory use and reproducibility in open-science contexts.

  At ~3m native GSD, SuperDove cannot resolve fine-grained features
  like individual cars, building footprints with precise edges,
  narrow sidewalks, or small structures. For those applications,
  SkySat (sub-meter) or aerial imagery (NAIP at 0.6m) is needed.

  Radiometric calibration can vary across the constellation. Because
  each SuperDove satellite is a small CubeSat with slightly different
  sensor characteristics, cross-satellite radiometric consistency is
  not as tight as single-instrument missions like Sentinel-2 or
  Landsat. Planet applies cross-calibration corrections, but subtle
  differences may persist and affect sensitive quantitative analysis
  (e.g., absolute reflectance comparisons across dates acquired by
  different satellites).

  No SWIR bands — cannot perform mineralogy, burn severity (NBR),
  or moisture-based indices that require shortwave infrared. For
  those applications, Sentinel-2 or Landsat is needed.

  No thermal band — cannot measure surface temperature.

  The archive for the 8-band SuperDove (PSB.SD) generation begins
  around 2020. Earlier Dove satellites had fewer bands and different
  spectral characteristics.

preprocessing_notes: |
  Surface reflectance products (PSScene analytic_sr) are already
  atmospherically corrected, so no additional atmospheric correction
  is typically needed.

  Cloud masking: Planet provides a Usable Data Mask (UDM2) with
  per-pixel cloud, shadow, haze, and snow classifications. Always
  apply UDM2 before analysis. The mask quality is generally good
  but may miss thin cirrus or haze in some scenes.

  In Hum's internal catalog, imagery is resampled to 1.0m and
  accessed via CollectionName.SUPERDOVE in the data engine. The
  band_ids are: ['Coastal Blue', 'Blue', 'Green I', 'Green',
  'Yellow', 'Red', 'Red Edge', 'Near-Infrared'].

  When building time series, be aware of the cross-satellite
  radiometric variability. For quantitative analysis, consider
  normalizing reflectance values or using relative indices rather
  than absolute reflectance.

  Planet scenes are typically delivered as individual strips or
  tiles. For large-area analysis, mosaicking is required. Planet
  provides basemaps (monthly and quarterly composites) that handle
  this, but they sacrifice temporal precision.
