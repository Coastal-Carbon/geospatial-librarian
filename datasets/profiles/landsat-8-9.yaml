provider: USGS / NASA

spatial:
  resolution: |
    30m: Visible (Blue, Green, Red), NIR, SWIR 1, SWIR 2
    15m: Panchromatic band (B8, Landsat 8 and 9)
    100m: Thermal Infrared (TIRS bands, resampled to 30m in distributed products)
  coverage: >
    Global land surfaces. Near-polar orbit provides complete global coverage
    between ~82°N and 82°S. Coverage includes open ocean scenes near coastlines.
  coordinate_system: UTM / WGS84 (scene-based, per path/row)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    16-day revisit per satellite. With both Landsat 8 and 9 operating,
    effective revisit is 8 days. Combined with Sentinel-2 in the
    Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) product, effective revisit
    approaches 2-3 days.
  archive_start: >
    Landsat 8: 2013-02-11. Landsat 9: 2021-09-27.
    The broader Landsat program archive extends back to 1972 (Landsat 1),
    providing the longest continuous satellite Earth observation record.
    Collection 2 reprocessing provides consistent calibration across
    the full archive.
  latency: >
    Typically 12-24 hours for Level-1 products. Level-2 (surface
    reflectance/temperature) available within a few days.

strengths: |
  Two unique advantages over Sentinel-2: a thermal infrared band and a
  50+ year archive.

  The thermal band (100m, resampled to 30m) enables surface temperature
  measurement — essential for urban heat island analysis, wildfire
  monitoring, evapotranspiration estimation, water temperature monitoring,
  and thermal anomaly detection. No other free satellite dataset provides
  co-registered thermal and optical multispectral data.

  The Landsat archive (back to 1972 with Landsat 1-5, 7) is irreplaceable
  for long-term change analysis. Urbanization over decades, deforestation
  trajectories, glacial retreat, and coastline change all require this
  historical depth. Collection 2 reprocessing ensures consistent
  calibration across the full archive.

  30m resolution with similar spectral bands to Sentinel-2 means most
  classification and analysis methods transfer between the two. The HLS
  product harmonizes them into a single time series, effectively giving
  you 2-3 day revisit at 30m.

  Pan-sharpening with the 15m panchromatic band can improve effective
  resolution for visual interpretation, though the spectral information
  is still at 30m.

limitations: |
  30m resolution is 3x coarser than Sentinel-2's 10m visible bands.
  Features that are marginally detectable in Sentinel-2 (individual
  large buildings, road networks) are often indistinguishable in Landsat.
  For feature extraction at building or parcel scale, Landsat is
  generally insufficient.

  No red edge bands — Sentinel-2's red edge bands (705-783nm) provide
  better vegetation characterization. For precision vegetation analysis,
  Sentinel-2 is preferred.

  16-day revisit (8-day with both satellites) is coarser than Sentinel-2's
  5-day revisit, meaning fewer cloud-free opportunities per time period.

  The thermal bands are at 100m native resolution (resampled to 30m in
  products), which limits thermal analysis to relatively coarse spatial
  patterns.

  Landsat 7 data (1999-2022) has the well-known SLC-off striping issue
  starting in 2003, requiring gap-filling for continuous spatial coverage.

preprocessing_notes: |
  Collection 2 Level-2 products are already atmospherically corrected
  to surface reflectance (optical) and surface temperature (thermal).
  No additional atmospheric correction needed for most applications.

  Cloud masking: Use the QA_PIXEL band. The Fmask algorithm underlying
  the QA flags is generally reliable but can struggle with bright
  surfaces (salt flats, snow edges) and thin cirrus.

  For cross-sensor time series with Sentinel-2, use the Harmonized
  Landsat Sentinel (HLS) product rather than trying to manually
  harmonize the two datasets. HLS handles bandpass differences,
  BRDF normalization, and gridding to a common tiling system.

  Landsat scenes follow the WRS-2 path/row system. For area-based
  work, you'll need to identify which path/row(s) cover your AOI
  using the WRS-2 reference shapefile.

  Thermal band calibration: For quantitative surface temperature work,
  be aware that the B11 thermal band on Landsat 8 has known stray
  light issues and USGS does not recommend it for quantitative use.
  Use B10 only.
