id: pleiades
name: Pleiades Neo (Airbus) Multispectral Imagery
provider: Airbus Defence and Space

spatial:
  resolution: |
    1m multispectral (resampled from native 1.2m GSD) for all 6 bands.
    Panchromatic band available at 0.3m but not ingested into Data Engine.
    All multispectral bands delivered at the same 1m resolution.
  coverage: >
    Global coverage via tasking (new acquisitions on demand) and archive
    (previously acquired scenes). Coverage density varies significantly —
    urban areas, commercial agriculture regions, and areas of strategic
    interest have extensive archive holdings. Remote or low-demand areas
    may have little to no existing archive and require new tasking.
    Commercial license required for access.
  coordinate_system: UTM / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Not a fixed revisit — Pleiades is a tasking-based constellation.
    The Pleiades Neo constellation (two satellites) can revisit any point
    on Earth daily, but actual acquisition depends on tasking priority
    and scheduling. Archive imagery availability varies by location.
  archive_start: "2012 (Pleiades 1A); Pleiades Neo from 2021"
  latency: >
    New tasking orders typically fulfilled within days to weeks depending
    on priority level and weather. Archive imagery available within hours
    of order placement. Data Engine access depends on Hum's ingestion
    pipeline from the Airbus OneAtlas platform.

bands:
  - "Coastal Blue (~443nm, 1m)"
  - "Blue (~490nm, 1m)"
  - "Green (~560nm, 1m)"
  - "Red (~665nm, 1m)"
  - "Vegetation Red Edge (~705nm, 1m)"
  - "Near-Infrared (~842nm, 1m)"

formats:
  native: GeoTIFF (Cloud-Optimized) served via Hum's internal STAC FastAPI
  common_conversions: >
    Already served as COG from Hum's STAC catalog. No format conversion
    typically needed for Data Engine workflows.

access:
  method: >
    Hum's internal STAC FastAPI catalog (catalog_id: 'stac-fastapi',
    collection_id: 'pleiades'). Accessed programmatically through the
    Data Engine library using CollectionName.PLEIADES.
  auth: >
    Commercial license required. Data is not publicly available. Access
    is through Hum's internal infrastructure, which holds licensed
    Pleiades imagery sourced from the Airbus OneAtlas platform.
    Individual users do not need their own Airbus license — Hum's
    organizational license covers Data Engine access.
  alternatives: >
    Airbus OneAtlas platform (direct commercial purchase). UP42 marketplace.
    Some archive scenes available through national mapping agencies or
    academic programs, but these are not integrated with the Data Engine.

strengths: |
  Sub-meter effective resolution (1m multispectral, 0.3m pan) combined
  with 6 spectral bands including a red edge band — a rare combination
  in commercial very-high-resolution imagery. Most VHR sensors offer
  only 4 bands (RGB+NIR), but Pleiades Neo adds Coastal Blue and
  Vegetation Red Edge, enabling more sophisticated spectral analysis
  at very high spatial resolution.

  The red edge band (~705nm) is particularly valuable for vegetation
  health assessment, crop stress detection, and species differentiation
  at the individual plant or tree scale. Combined with the NIR band,
  you can compute NDRE (Normalized Difference Red Edge) at 1m resolution,
  which is highly sensitive to chlorophyll content and canopy structure.

  At 1m resolution, individual buildings, vehicles, narrow roads,
  driveways, and even large individual trees are clearly resolvable.
  This makes it ideal for urban mapping, infrastructure monitoring,
  precision agriculture, and detailed environmental assessments where
  Sentinel-2's 10m resolution is insufficient.

  The Coastal Blue band (~443nm) is useful for shallow water mapping,
  coastal habitat assessment, and atmospheric correction. Together with
  the standard Blue band, it provides better discrimination of water
  turbidity and benthic features.

  Already ingested into Hum's STAC catalog, making it accessible
  through the standard Data Engine pipeline without separate procurement.

limitations: |
  Commercial and expensive — this is not open data. Availability is
  limited to what Hum has licensed and ingested. You cannot freely
  browse or access the full Airbus archive through the Data Engine.

  Tasking-based acquisition means archive coverage is highly uneven.
  Many areas of the world, particularly remote or low-commercial-interest
  regions, will have sparse or no Pleiades coverage in Hum's holdings.
  Always check data availability before designing a workflow around
  Pleiades data.

  No fixed revisit cadence makes time series analysis difficult. Unlike
  Sentinel-2's systematic 5-day revisit, Pleiades acquisitions are
  opportunistic. Building consistent temporal stacks for change detection
  requires careful scene selection and may have large temporal gaps.

  The spectral range, while better than most VHR sensors, still lacks
  SWIR bands. This means no moisture-related indices (NDMI, NBR) and
  limited ability to distinguish materials that differ primarily in
  the shortwave infrared. For SWIR analysis, pair with Sentinel-2.

  High spatial resolution means very large file sizes. A single scene
  can be several gigabytes. Processing large areas requires substantial
  compute resources and careful tiling strategies.

  Not suitable for broad-area screening or monitoring — cost and coverage
  constraints mean Pleiades is best used for targeted, high-priority
  sites rather than wall-to-wall regional mapping.

preprocessing_notes: |
  Pleiades imagery in Hum's STAC catalog is already orthorectified and
  delivered as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, so no geometric correction or
  format conversion is needed for standard Data Engine workflows.

  When combining Pleiades with Sentinel-2 or other data sources in a
  multi-source project, pay attention to resolution mismatches. The Data
  Engine handles resampling via the CollectionInput resolution parameter,
  but consider which resolution is appropriate for your analysis.

  For vegetation indices using the red edge band, note that the band
  wavelength metadata in the Data Engine is approximate (marked as TODO
  in the source code). Verify exact wavelengths against Airbus product
  documentation if precise spectral calibration matters for your analysis.

  Band order in the Data Engine follows the SOURCE_INFO definition:
  Coastal Blue, Blue, Green, Red, Vegetation Red Edge, Near-Infrared
  (indices 0-5). This differs from some Airbus product orderings.

  Cloud masking is not automatically provided as with Sentinel-2 L2A.
  You may need to implement your own cloud detection or use the Data
  Engine's quality filtering capabilities.

  For cross-sensor analysis (e.g., Pleiades + Sentinel-2), be aware
  that the sensors have different spectral response functions even for
  nominally similar bands. Direct reflectance comparison across sensors
  requires harmonization.
