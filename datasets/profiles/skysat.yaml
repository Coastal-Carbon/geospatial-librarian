name: Planet SkySat Multispectral Imagery
provider: Planet Labs PBC

spatial:
  resolution: |
    ~0.5m panchromatic (pan-sharpened products), ~1m multispectral (4-band).
    All four spectral bands delivered at the same resolution. The
    SOURCE_INFO in the data engine records the working resolution as 1.0m
    for the multispectral product.
  coverage: >
    Global (tasking and archive). SkySat is a commercial tasking constellation,
    so coverage depends on what has been ordered and acquired. The archive
    contains imagery over areas of commercial interest — urban centers,
    infrastructure, agricultural regions, disaster zones — but is not a
    systematic global survey. Gaps are expected over open ocean, polar
    regions, and areas with no customer demand.
  coordinate_system: UTM / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    The SkySat constellation (21 satellites as of 2024) can revisit any
    point on Earth multiple times per day when tasked. Archive revisit
    varies by location — high-demand areas may have daily or weekly
    coverage, while other areas may have only a handful of acquisitions.
    Not a systematic survey mission — revisit is demand-driven.
  archive_start: "2013 (initial SkySat-1 launch); constellation expanded significantly 2017-2020"
  latency: >
    Near real-time tasking turnaround is possible (hours). Archive imagery
    available through Hum's internal STAC FastAPI is queryable immediately.
    New tasking orders typically delivered within 24 hours of acquisition.

bands:
  - "Blue (visible, ~450-515nm, 1m)"
  - "Green (visible, ~515-595nm, 1m)"
  - "Red (visible, ~605-695nm, 1m)"
  - "NIR (near-infrared, ~740-900nm, 1m)"

formats:
  native: >
    GeoTIFF (orthorectified, radiometrically corrected). Planet delivers
    ortho scene and ortho collect products. Scenes are individual camera
    frames; collects are mosaicked strips.
  common_conversions: >
    Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). Data in Hum's STAC catalog is stored
    as COG for efficient cloud-native access.

access:
  method: >
    Hum's internal STAC FastAPI (catalog_id: 'stac-fastapi',
    collection_id: 'skysat'). Queried via the hum_ai.stac.search module
    and the data engine's CollectionName.SKYSAT enum.
  auth: >
    Commercial license — requires Hum platform credentials. Not publicly
    accessible. Planet API access requires a separate Planet subscription
    for direct tasking or archive access outside Hum's holdings.
  alternatives: >
    Planet Explorer (planet.com) for browsing and ordering directly from
    Planet. Google Earth Engine hosts some SkySat archive imagery. Planet's
    own STAC-compliant Orders API for programmatic access with a Planet
    subscription.

strengths: |
  Sub-meter resolution (0.5m pan-sharpened, 1m multispectral) makes SkySat
  one of the highest-resolution commercial optical sensors available. At
  this resolution, individual vehicles, building structural details, narrow
  roads, small boats, and infrastructure components are clearly visible.

  The 21-satellite constellation enables extremely high revisit rates —
  multiple passes per day over tasked areas. This makes SkySat particularly
  well-suited for rapid change detection, disaster response monitoring,
  construction progress tracking, and any application requiring frequent
  temporal updates at very high spatial resolution.

  SkySat's unique video capability (up to 120 seconds of HD video at
  30fps from orbit) enables moving-object analysis — traffic flow, vessel
  tracking, and event monitoring — that no other commercial optical sensor
  at this price point provides.

  The NIR band enables basic vegetation analysis (NDVI) at sub-meter
  resolution, which is valuable for precision agriculture, urban tree
  canopy assessment, and fine-scale habitat mapping where 10m Sentinel-2
  data is too coarse.

  Already ingested into Hum's STAC FastAPI, so it integrates directly
  with the data engine pipeline via CollectionName.SKYSAT — no additional
  data procurement workflow needed for imagery in the existing archive.

limitations: |
  Commercial data — requires a paid license. Not suitable for projects
  that need open/free data, and redistribution is restricted by Planet's
  licensing terms.

  Only 4 spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR). No red edge, no SWIR,
  no thermal. This significantly limits spectral analysis compared to
  Sentinel-2 (13 bands), Pleiades Neo (6 bands with red edge), or
  WorldView (8 bands). You can compute NDVI but not red-edge indices
  (NDRE), moisture indices (NDMI/NDWI using SWIR), or burn indices (NBR).

  Lower spectral capability than other commercial VHR sensors:
  Pleiades Neo offers a red edge band, and WorldView-3 offers 8
  multispectral bands plus SWIR. If spectral discrimination is critical
  (e.g., mineral mapping, detailed vegetation species classification),
  SkySat is not the best choice.

  Archive coverage is patchy and demand-driven — unlike Sentinel-2 or
  Landsat which systematically image the entire globe, SkySat only has
  data where someone paid to collect it. For a given AOI, you may find
  zero archive imagery, or you may need to submit a new tasking order.

  Smaller swath width (~8km for individual scenes) compared to Sentinel-2
  (~290km) or Landsat (~185km) means covering large areas requires many
  scenes and is significantly more expensive.

preprocessing_notes: |
  SkySat imagery in Hum's STAC catalog is delivered as orthorectified,
  radiometrically corrected GeoTIFF (visual or analytic products). For
  most workflows, no additional geometric correction is needed.

  For quantitative analysis (e.g., time-series NDVI comparison), verify
  that you are using the analytic (surface reflectance) product rather
  than the visual (display-optimized) product. The analytic product has
  calibrated reflectance values suitable for spectral index computation.

  When combining SkySat with other sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2 for spectral
  depth), be aware of the resolution mismatch. You will need to either
  downsample SkySat to match Sentinel-2's 10m grid, or upsample Sentinel-2
  (with appropriate caveats about information content). The data engine
  handles this via the CollectionInput resolution parameter.

  Band order in the data engine is: Blue (0), Green (1), Red (2), NIR (3),
  matching the COLLECTION_BAND_MAP in ingredients.py. The band IDs used
  for STAC asset access are: 'Blue', 'Green', 'Red', 'Near-Infrared'.

  For large-area mosaicking, note that SkySat scenes have a small footprint.
  Expect to mosaic many scenes for areas larger than a few square km.
  Radiometric consistency across scenes acquired on different dates may
  require cross-calibration or relative normalization.

  At sub-meter resolution, pixel-based classification methods are generally
  ineffective. Use object-based image analysis (OBIA) or deep learning
  (semantic segmentation) approaches instead.
