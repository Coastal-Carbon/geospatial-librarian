provider: Maxar Technologies

spatial:
  resolution: |
    ~0.5m: Panchromatic (single band, grayscale)
    ~1.84m (native) / ~2.0m (commercial product): 8 multispectral bands
    Pan-sharpened products available at ~0.5m with multispectral color
  coverage: >
    Global — the largest commercial very-high-resolution satellite imagery
    archive in existence. WorldView-2 (launched 2009) and WorldView-3
    (launched 2014) provide the 8-band multispectral capability. Coverage
    is tasked (collected on demand or from archive), not systematic like
    Sentinel-2, so spatial completeness varies by region. Urban areas,
    conflict zones, and areas of commercial interest have the densest
    archives. Remote/low-demand areas may have sparse coverage.
  coordinate_system: UTM zones / WGS84 (varies by product)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Tasking-based revisit, not a fixed cadence. WorldView constellation
    can theoretically revisit any point on Earth in ~1 day, but actual
    collection depends on tasking priority and cloud conditions. Archive
    imagery is available for many areas with multiple acquisitions per
    year in high-demand regions.
  archive_start: "2009 (WorldView-2); 2014 (WorldView-3 with full 8-band MS)"
  latency: >
    New tasking orders typically delivered within days to weeks depending
    on priority level. Archive imagery available within hours of order
    placement via Hum's internal STAC catalog.

bands:
  - "Coastal Blue (425nm, ~1.84m)"
  - "Blue (480nm, ~1.84m)"
  - "Green (545nm, ~1.84m)"
  - "Yellow (610nm, ~1.84m)"
  - "Red (660nm, ~1.84m)"
  - "Red Edge (730nm, ~1.84m)"
  - "Near-Infrared 1 (835nm, ~1.84m)"
  - "Near-Infrared 2 (950nm, ~1.84m)"
  - "Panchromatic (~0.5m, single broadband visible)"

formats:
  native: GeoTIFF (typically delivered as orthorectified strips or tiles)
  common_conversions: >
    Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). Imagery in Hum's STAC catalog is
    served as COG. Pan-sharpened products merge panchromatic detail
    with multispectral color at ~0.5m.

access:
  method: >
    Hum's internal STAC FastAPI catalog — collection ID "worldview".
    Search and access via the data engine library using
    CollectionName.WORLDVIEW. Imagery is stored in Hum's cloud
    infrastructure and served through the STAC API.
  auth: >
    Commercial license — requires Hum platform access. WorldView
    imagery is among the most expensive commercial EO data. Tasking
    new acquisitions costs significantly more than archive purchases.

strengths: |
  The gold standard for very-high-resolution commercial Earth observation.
  The ~0.5m panchromatic resolution is the industry benchmark for optical
  detail — sufficient to identify individual vehicles, small structures,
  narrow roads, and fine-grained land cover features. Pan-sharpened
  products combine this spatial detail with multispectral information.

  The 8-band multispectral capability is unique among VHR satellites.
  The Yellow band (~610nm) is rare in satellite sensors and improves
  discrimination of vegetation stress, senescence, and certain material
  types. The dual NIR bands (NIR1 at 835nm, NIR2 at 950nm) enable more
  nuanced vegetation and water analysis than sensors with a single NIR
  band — NIR2 in particular is less affected by atmospheric water vapor
  absorption, making it useful for atmospheric characterization and
  more robust NDVI calculations.

  The Coastal Blue band (~425nm) penetrates shallow water better than
  standard blue, enabling bathymetric mapping and benthic habitat
  classification in clear coastal waters.

  Maxar's archive is the largest commercial VHR collection in the world,
  with imagery spanning back to the early 2000s (including legacy
  QuickBird and WorldView-1 data). For historical high-resolution
  analysis, there is often no alternative.

  Stereo collection capability enables 3D surface model generation
  (DSMs) from stereo pairs — useful for building height estimation,
  terrain modeling, and volumetric analysis at sub-meter resolution.

limitations: |
  The most expensive dataset in the catalog. Archive imagery costs
  several dollars per square kilometer, and new tasking costs
  substantially more. Budget constraints often limit the spatial or
  temporal extent of analysis. For broad-area monitoring, Sentinel-2
  or Landsat are far more cost-effective.

  Large data volumes — a single WorldView scene at full resolution can
  be several gigabytes. Multi-date analysis over large areas generates
  very large datasets that require significant storage and processing
  infrastructure.

  Requires careful orthorectification. Raw or basic-level products have
  significant geometric distortions, especially in areas with terrain
  relief. Accurate orthorectification requires a good DEM (Copernicus
  DEM or better). Without proper orthorectification, multi-temporal
  analysis and fusion with other datasets will have alignment errors.

  Tasking-based collection means no guaranteed revisit cadence. Unlike
  Sentinel-2's systematic 5-day revisit, WorldView imagery is collected
  when tasked or opportunistically. Time series analysis requires
  careful assessment of what archive imagery is actually available for
  your AOI and time period.

  Cloud cover is a constraint as with all optical sensors. At ~0.5m
  resolution, even thin clouds and haze significantly degrade image
  quality. No onboard cloud masking layer is provided — cloud detection
  must be performed as part of preprocessing.

  No SWIR or thermal bands. Cannot perform the SWIR-based analyses
  possible with Sentinel-2 or Landsat (burn severity, mineral mapping,
  moisture content). For those capabilities at high resolution, no
  single-sensor solution currently exists.

preprocessing_notes: |
  Orthorectification is critical. If working with Ortho Ready Standard
  (OR2A) products, apply a DEM-based orthorectification using the
  provided RPCs (Rational Polynomial Coefficients). Copernicus DEM
  GLO-30 is usually sufficient for flat to moderate terrain; use a
  higher-resolution DEM for mountainous areas. Products ordered as
  "Ortho" from Maxar are pre-orthorectified but verify alignment
  against reference data.

  Radiometric calibration: WorldView imagery is delivered as digital
  numbers (DN). Convert to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance using
  the calibration coefficients in the metadata (IMD/XML files). For
  surface reflectance, apply atmospheric correction (e.g., FLAASH,
  6S, or empirical line method). No standard L2A product exists as
  with Sentinel-2.

  Pan-sharpening: If you need multispectral analysis at ~0.5m, apply
  a pan-sharpening algorithm (Gram-Schmidt, Brovey, or NNDiffuse) to
  merge the panchromatic and multispectral bands. Be aware that
  pan-sharpening can introduce spectral distortion — validate band
  ratios and indices against the native multispectral data.

  Cloud/shadow detection: No SCL equivalent is provided. Use automated
  cloud detection tools (e.g., Fmask adapted for VHR, or deep learning
  approaches) or manual QA. Shadow detection is especially important
  at sub-meter resolution where building shadows can cover significant
  portions of urban scenes.

  For the data engine: WorldView imagery is accessed via
  CollectionName.WORLDVIEW from Hum's STAC FastAPI catalog. The 8
  multispectral bands are available with IDs: 'Coastal Blue', 'Blue',
  'Green', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Red Edge', 'Near-Infrared 1',
  'Near-Infrared 2'. Native resolution is 1.84m; commercial products
  are typically resampled to 2.0m. Data type is uint16 with a missing
  value of 0.
