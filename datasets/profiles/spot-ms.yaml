  resolution: |
    6m: B0 (Blue), B1 (Green), B2 (Red), B3 (NIR) — multispectral
    1.5m: Panchromatic band (single broadband visible)
    Pan-sharpened products available at 1.5m using MS+PAN fusion.
  coverage: >
    Global coverage through a combination of deep archive imagery and
    on-demand tasking. The SPOT program has been acquiring imagery since
    1986 (SPOT-1), with the current generation (SPOT-6/7) operating since
    2012/2014. Archive density is highest over Europe, North Africa, and
    populated regions worldwide. Tasking is available for any land area.
  coordinate_system: UTM / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    SPOT-6 and SPOT-7 together provide a 1-day revisit capability at
    off-nadir angles (up to 30 degrees). Nadir revisit is approximately
    26 days per satellite. In practice, archive availability for any
    given location depends on tasking history — not every location has
    frequent repeat coverage like free satellites provide.
  archive_start: "1986 (SPOT-1, 10-20m); 2012 (SPOT-6, 6m/1.5m); 2014 (SPOT-7, 6m/1.5m)"
  latency: >
    Archive imagery available within hours of order. New tasking requests
    typically fulfilled within days to weeks depending on priority level,
    cloud conditions, and satellite scheduling.

    and hosted internally. Access requires Hum platform credentials and
    appropriate project authorization.

    resellers and government programs (e.g., ESA Third Party Missions).

strengths: |
  Long heritage and deep archive. The SPOT program has been continuously
  acquiring imagery since 1986 — one of the longest-running commercial
  Earth observation programs. This provides an unmatched archive for
  historical change analysis spanning nearly four decades, which no free
  satellite (Landsat aside) can match at this resolution class.

  The 6m multispectral resolution bridges a useful gap between Sentinel-2
  (10m, free) and very-high-resolution commercial satellites like Pleiades
  (2m) or WorldView (1.2-1.8m). At 6m, you can distinguish individual
  buildings, road segments, field boundaries, and land-use parcels with
  more confidence than Sentinel-2, while the data volume and cost remain
  lower than sub-meter imagery.

  The panchromatic band at 1.5m provides a significant resolution boost
  for visual interpretation and pan-sharpening workflows. Pan-sharpened
  SPOT products at 1.5m approach VHR capability at a lower price point.

  Four-band multispectral (Blue, Green, Red, NIR) supports standard
  vegetation indices (NDVI), water detection (NDWI), and basic land
  cover classification — the core remote sensing workflows.

  As a reliable commercial option from Airbus, SPOT imagery comes with
  consistent quality, professional support, and well-documented metadata.
  It is a solid workhorse for projects that need better-than-Sentinel-2
  resolution without the cost of sub-meter imagery.

limitations: |
  Commercial data — requires procurement from Airbus or access through
  Hum's licensed archive. Not free or open, which limits ad-hoc
  exploration and restricts sharing of derived products depending on
  license terms.

  Only 4 multispectral bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR). No red edge bands,
  no SWIR, no thermal. This limits spectral analysis compared to
  Sentinel-2 (13 bands) or Landsat (11 bands). You cannot compute
  advanced vegetation indices (NDRE), moisture indices (NDMI/NDWI using
  SWIR), or burn severity indices (NBR) from SPOT-MS alone.

  At 6m, the multispectral imagery is not sub-meter. You can see
  buildings as shapes but cannot resolve fine details like individual
  cars, sidewalks, driveways, or small structures. For tasks requiring
  sub-meter detail, Pleiades, WorldView, or SkySat are better choices.

  Archive coverage is tasking-driven, not systematic. Unlike Sentinel-2
  or Landsat which image the entire globe on a fixed schedule, SPOT
  archive density varies greatly by location. Popular areas (cities,
  agriculture regions, conflict zones) have dense archives; remote or
  low-interest areas may have sparse or no coverage.

  SPOT-6/7 are being superseded by newer constellations. Airbus now
  operates Pleiades Neo (30cm) and promotes it as the next-generation
  product. SPOT-6/7 will eventually reach end of life, and future
  archive growth will slow.

  Radiometric consistency across the 40-year archive requires care.
  SPOT-1 through SPOT-5 had different sensors, resolutions (10-20m),
  and calibration characteristics than SPOT-6/7. Cross-generation
  comparison requires careful normalization.

preprocessing_notes: |
  SPOT data from Hum's catalog is orthorectified and stored as COG in
  the STAC collection. Band IDs in the data engine are B0 (Blue), B1
  (Green), B2 (Red), B3 (NIR), with values stored as uint16.

  The missing_value is 0 — mask out zero-valued pixels before analysis
  to avoid including nodata areas in statistics or classifications.

  If pan-sharpening is needed, the panchromatic band must be ordered
  separately or as part of a bundle product from Airbus. Pan-sharpening
  algorithms (Brovey, Gram-Schmidt, etc.) are available in most
  geospatial toolkits (GDAL, rasterio, orfeo-toolbox).

  For cross-sensor workflows (e.g., fusing with Sentinel-2), resample
  SPOT 6m to 10m or Sentinel-2 10m to 6m depending on which resolution
  you want to work at. Use bilinear or cubic resampling for continuous
  reflectance data.

  Reflectance values may need radiometric normalization if comparing
  across dates or with other sensors. SPOT-6/7 products can be delivered
  as top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, but surface reflectance
  correction may require additional processing if not included in the
  product level ordered.

  When searching via the data engine, use CollectionName.SPOT_MS with
  the standard STAC search interface. Band order in SOURCE_INFO is
  Blue, Green, Red, NIR (indices 0-3).
