spatial:
  resolution: >
    Feature-level. Individual buildings, roads, parking lots, waterways,
    land use polygons, and points of interest are mapped as discrete
    vector geometries (points, lines, polygons) with attribute tags.
  coverage: >
    Global, but completeness varies enormously by region. Urban areas in
    North America, Western Europe, and Japan tend to be very well-mapped.
    Rural areas, developing countries, and some suburban areas may have
    significant gaps. Coverage is a function of volunteer mapper activity.
  coordinate_system: WGS84 (EPSG:4326)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Continuous community edits — the dataset is updated in near real-time
    as mappers contribute. However, any individual feature may not have
    been updated in years. There is no systematic revisit schedule.
  archive_start: "2004 (project founding); substantial coverage from ~2010 onward"
  latency: Near real-time for individual edits. Bulk extracts update daily to weekly.

feature_classes:
  - "buildings (building=*) — footprint polygons with type tags"
  - "parking (amenity=parking) — surface lots and structures"
  - "roads (highway=*) — full road network hierarchy from motorways to footpaths"
  - "land use (landuse=*) — residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural zones"
  - "natural features (natural=*) — water bodies, forests, beaches, peaks"
  - "waterways (waterway=*) — rivers, streams, canals"
  - "points of interest — shops, restaurants, hospitals, schools, etc."
  - "administrative boundaries (admin_level=*) — countries to neighborhoods"
  - "power infrastructure, railways, pipelines, and many more"

formats:
  native: >
    OSM XML or PBF (Protocolbuffer Binary Format). The full planet
    file is ~70GB compressed in PBF format.
  common_conversions: >
    GeoJSON, GeoPackage, Shapefile, GeoParquet. Thematic extracts
    are typically served in these formats by downstream providers.

access:
  method: >
    Planet.osm download from planet.openstreetmap.org for the full
    dataset. For most use cases, use a thematic extract service instead.
    Overpass API for targeted queries by feature type and geographic area.
  auth: Free, no registration required for most access methods.
  alternatives: >
    Geofabrik daily extracts (regional PBF/Shapefile files — most common
    for bulk regional data). BBBike extracts for custom geographic areas.
    HOT (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) Export Tool for custom thematic
    extracts. Overture Maps Foundation (incorporates OSM data with quality
    improvements). ohsome API for historical OSM analysis.
    Microsoft Building Footprints and Google Open Buildings provide
    ML-derived alternatives for building coverage gaps.

strengths: |
  The only free, global, feature-level vector dataset with semantic labels.
  When OSM coverage is good for your area of interest, it provides exactly
  what many analyses need: pre-classified features with polygon boundaries
  that can be used directly without any image interpretation or
  classification workflow.

  Rich attribute tagging system means features carry meaningful metadata
  beyond just geometry — building type, road surface material, number of
  lanes, opening hours for POIs, etc. This semantic richness is unique
  among free global datasets.

  For training machine learning models on satellite or aerial imagery,
  OSM features are widely used as training labels (e.g., building
  footprints from OSM used to train a building detector on Sentinel-2
  or NAIP imagery).

  The Overpass API allows very specific queries — you can request all
  parking lots within a bounding box, or all hospitals within a city,
  without downloading the entire regional dataset.

  Active community means features are generally kept up-to-date in
  well-mapped areas. New construction, demolished buildings, and road
  changes are often reflected within weeks to months.

limitations: |
  Coverage inconsistency is the fundamental limitation. A parking lot
  analysis using OSM might find 95% of lots in Portland, Oregon but
  only 30% in a rural Texas county. You cannot assume completeness
  without checking coverage for your specific AOI first.

  No systematic quality assurance — data quality depends on individual
  mapper skill and local community standards. Geometry precision varies,
  attribute completeness varies, and there can be tagging inconsistencies
  (e.g., some mappers tag parking lots as amenity=parking, others as
  landuse=surface).

  Historical analysis is possible through the ohsome API but requires
  specialized tooling. The standard extracts only give you the current
  state, not what existed at a past date.

  License (ODbL) requires attribution and share-alike for derived
  databases. This is not an issue for most analyses but can be a
  constraint for some commercial products.

  Not a remotely sensed dataset — it cannot tell you about surface
  properties, spectral characteristics, elevation, or anything that
  requires physical measurement. It tells you what humans have labeled,
  not what sensors have detected.

preprocessing_notes: |
  For targeted extraction, use the Overpass API with a query like:
  [out:json];area[name="Phoenix"]->.searchArea;
  (way["amenity"="parking"](area.searchArea););out body;>;out skel qt;

  Geofabrik regional extracts are the easiest starting point for
  bulk processing. Download the PBF file for your region and filter
  with osmium, ogr2ogr, or osm2pgsql.

  Tag interpretation requires familiarity with the OSM tagging schema.
  The OSM Wiki (wiki.openstreetmap.org) documents the tag conventions.
  Be prepared for some features using non-standard or deprecated tags.

  For building footprints specifically, consider also checking Microsoft
  Building Footprints and Google Open Buildings, which may fill coverage
  gaps in areas where OSM mapping is sparse.

  When using OSM as training labels for ML models, be aware of label
  noise — OSM geometries may not align perfectly with imagery,
  especially in areas with older or less precise mapping.
