spatial:
  resolution: |
    5.3m: All 23 hyperspectral bands at uniform resolution.
    Every band from 503nm to 799nm is delivered at the same 5.3m GSD.
  coverage: >
    Global coverage via tasking (new acquisitions on demand) and archive.
    Wyvern is a relatively new commercial constellation, so archive holdings
    are still growing. Coverage density is uneven — areas that have been
    tasked will have data, but broad systematic coverage comparable to
    Sentinel-2 should not be expected. Commercial license required.
  coordinate_system: UTM / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    Tasking-based constellation — not a fixed revisit schedule.
    Revisit capability is growing as the constellation expands.
    Actual acquisition depends on tasking priority and scheduling.
    Archive imagery availability varies by location.
  archive_start: "2023 (early commercial operations)"
  latency: >
    Tasking orders fulfilled on a commercial schedule. Archive imagery
    accessible through Hum's STAC FastAPI after ingestion. Latency
    depends on Hum's ingestion pipeline from Wyvern's delivery system.

formats:
  native: GeoTIFF (Cloud-Optimized) served via Hum's internal STAC FastAPI
  common_conversions: >
    Already served as COG from Hum's STAC catalog. No format conversion
    typically needed for Data Engine workflows.

access:
  method: >
    Hum's internal STAC FastAPI catalog (catalog_id: 'stac-fastapi',
    collection_id: 'wyvern'). Accessed programmatically through the
    Data Engine library using CollectionName.WYVERN.
  auth: >
    Commercial license required. Data is not publicly available. Access
    is through Hum's internal infrastructure, which holds licensed
    Wyvern imagery. Individual users do not need their own Wyvern
    license — Hum's organizational license covers Data Engine access.
  alternatives: >
    Wyvern's own commercial platform (direct purchase). No public or
    open-access mirrors exist for this data.

strengths: |
  The only hyperspectral satellite dataset in this catalog. With 23
  contiguous bands spanning 503-799nm at approximately 10-15nm spectral
  sampling intervals, Wyvern provides fine spectral discrimination that
  is fundamentally impossible with broadband multispectral sensors like
  Sentinel-2, SuperDove, or Pleiades.

  This contiguous spectral coverage enables analysis that no other dataset
  in the catalog can support:

  - Mineral identification: Narrow absorption features in the visible and
    near-infrared can distinguish specific mineral compositions (iron oxides,
    clays, carbonates) that appear identical in broadband imagery.
  - Vegetation species differentiation: Subtle spectral signatures in the
    red edge (711-782nm) and green (503-570nm) regions allow separation of
    plant species that have nearly identical NDVI values. The 6 red edge
    bands provide far more detailed characterization of chlorophyll content,
    leaf structure, and canopy chemistry than Sentinel-2's 3 red edge bands.
  - Water quality analysis: Contiguous visible bands (503-699nm) enable
    detection of chlorophyll-a concentrations, suspended sediments, colored
    dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and harmful algal blooms through their
    distinct spectral absorption signatures.
  - Soil composition analysis: The continuous spectral profile across the
    visible-NIR range helps discriminate soil types, organic matter content,
    and moisture conditions.

  At 5.3m resolution, individual buildings, road segments, and large trees
  are resolvable, making this a moderate-to-high spatial resolution dataset
  as well. The combination of hyperspectral detail with meter-scale spatial
  resolution is rare in the satellite industry.

  Already ingested into Hum's STAC catalog, making it accessible through
  the standard Data Engine pipeline without separate procurement.

limitations: |
  Commercial and relatively expensive — this is not open data. Availability
  is limited to what Hum has licensed and ingested from Wyvern.

  Wyvern is a relatively new and small constellation. Archive holdings are
  limited compared to mature programs like Sentinel-2 or Landsat. Do not
  assume coverage exists for a given area and time — always check
  availability before designing a workflow around Wyvern data.

  No fixed revisit cadence. Tasking-based acquisition makes consistent
  time series analysis difficult. For temporal monitoring, pair with a
  systematic mission like Sentinel-2 or SuperDove.

  Spectral range is limited to 503-799nm (visible through near-infrared).
  There are no SWIR bands (1000-2500nm), which means moisture-related
  indices (NDMI, NBR) and many mineral identification features in the
  SWIR are not available. For SWIR analysis, pair with Sentinel-2 or
  Landsat.

  Hyperspectral data volumes are large. With 23 bands per scene at uint16
  precision, a single acquisition produces substantially more data than a
  comparable multispectral scene. Processing workflows must account for
  higher memory and storage requirements.

  Hyperspectral analysis requires specialized techniques. Standard
  broadband indices (NDVI, NDWI) can be computed but do not fully exploit
  the spectral richness. To realize the full value of this data, analysts
  should be familiar with spectral unmixing, continuum removal, derivative
  spectroscopy, or machine learning approaches designed for high-dimensional
  spectral data.

  No built-in cloud mask or scene classification layer is provided. Cloud
  and shadow detection must be handled by the analyst.

preprocessing_notes: |
  Wyvern imagery in Hum's STAC catalog is served as Cloud-Optimized
  GeoTIFFs, so no format conversion is needed for standard Data Engine
  workflows.

  Band values are stored as uint16 with a missing_value of 0. Be aware
  that zero-valued pixels represent no-data, not a valid reflectance
  measurement.

  When working with all 23 bands, data volumes are significant. If your
  analysis only requires specific spectral regions, select a subset of
  band_ids in the CollectionInput to reduce I/O and memory usage. For
  example, a vegetation-focused analysis might use only the red edge
  bands (Band_711nm through Band_782nm) plus a red reference band.

  For cross-sensor analysis (e.g., Wyvern + Sentinel-2), note that
  Wyvern's narrow bands do not correspond 1:1 to Sentinel-2's broadband
  channels. A single Sentinel-2 band integrates signal across a wide
  wavelength range that may span several Wyvern bands. Harmonization
  requires either spectral convolution of Wyvern bands to match
  Sentinel-2's spectral response functions, or working in a common
  spectral feature space.

  Cloud masking is not automatically provided. Implement your own cloud
  detection or use quality filtering capabilities in the Data Engine.

  For spectral analysis techniques (continuum removal, derivative
  analysis, spectral angle mapping), the bands should be treated as an
  ordered spectral sequence from 503nm to 799nm. The band_names in
  SOURCE_INFO encode both the spectral region and wavelength (e.g.,
  Green_503, Red_649, Rededge_711, Nir_799).
