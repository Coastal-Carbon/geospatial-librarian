  coverage: >
    Global land surfaces between 56°S and 84°N latitude.
    No coverage over open ocean (by design — land mission).
    Some small islands may have gaps.
  coordinate_system: UTM zones / WGS84 (EPSG varies by zone)

temporal:
  cadence: >
    5-day revisit at the equator using both Sentinel-2A and 2B.
    Higher effective revisit at higher latitudes due to orbit overlap.
    In practice, cloud cover reduces usable revisit to ~10-15 days
    in many temperate regions.

    Typically 24-48 hours from acquisition to availability on
    Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. Near real-time products
    available through some commercial platforms.

strengths: |
  The best free multispectral satellite imagery for most land surface
  applications. The combination of 10m visible/NIR bands with 20m red edge
  and SWIR bands makes it uniquely versatile — you can do everything from
  basic RGB visual inspection to sophisticated vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI,
  NDRE), water detection (NDWI, MNDWI), burn severity (NBR), and built-up
  area mapping.

  The 10m visible bands are sufficient to identify individual buildings,
  large parking lots, road networks, agricultural field boundaries, and
  other features roughly 10m or larger. The 5-day revisit enables time
  series analysis for change detection, crop monitoring, and seasonal
  pattern analysis.

  L2A processing means atmospherically corrected surface reflectance —
  you can compare values across dates and locations without additional
  atmospheric correction. The SCL (Scene Classification Layer) provides
  per-pixel cloud, shadow, water, and vegetation masks.

  Massively supported ecosystem: virtually every geospatial platform,
  tutorial, and tool chain supports Sentinel-2. Finding help is easy.

limitations: |
  Cannot see through clouds — this is the primary operational constraint.
  In tropical regions and maritime climates, cloud-free imagery may only
  be available a few times per year. Composite/mosaic approaches help
  but introduce temporal mixing.

  10m resolution cannot resolve individual cars, small structures (<10m),
  or fine details like sidewalks, driveways, or garden features. For
  sub-building-scale analysis, you need aerial imagery (NAIP) or
  commercial very-high-resolution satellites.

  No thermal infrared band — cannot measure surface temperature. For
  thermal applications (urban heat islands, fire hotspots, water
  temperature), use Landsat 8/9 instead.

  Tile boundaries follow the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS),
  which doesn't align with UTM zone boundaries or administrative
  boundaries. Mosaicking across tiles requires handling overlaps and
  potential slight radiometric differences at edges.

  Archive only goes back to 2015 — for historical analysis before that,
  Landsat provides continuity back to 1972.

preprocessing_notes: |
  L2A is already atmospherically corrected, so no additional atmospheric
  correction is needed for most applications.

  Cloud masking: Use the SCL band for basic cloud/shadow masking. For
  more aggressive masking, consider s2cloudless (available in GEE and
  as a Python library). The SCL occasionally misclassifies bright
  buildings or sand as cloud, and can miss thin cirrus.

  Mosaicking across UTM zones requires reprojection — tiles near zone
  boundaries will be in different CRS. Decide on a target CRS before
  mosaicking.

  For time series analysis, consider using harmonized Sentinel-2 (available
  on GEE) which accounts for the processing baseline change in January 2022
  that shifted some band values.

  If working with 20m bands alongside 10m bands, you'll need to resample.
  Bilinear or cubic resampling is typical for continuous data; nearest
  neighbor for classification inputs.
