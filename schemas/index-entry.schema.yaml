# Schema for Tier 1 index entries (datasets/index.yaml)
# Each dataset in the index should have these fields.
# The index is loaded fully into the librarian agent's context
# so entries should be concise — detailed info goes in the full profile.

fields:
  id:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the dataset. Use lowercase with hyphens.
      This must match the filename in datasets/profiles/{id}.yaml

  name:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: >
      Human-readable name of the dataset.

  type:
    type: string
    required: true
    enum: [raster, vector, point-cloud, tabular]
    description: >
      Primary geometry/data type.

  modality:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: >
      How the data was collected or what kind of information it represents.
      Examples: optical-multispectral, optical-rgb, SAR, lidar, elevation,
      crowdsourced-features, administrative-boundaries, land-cover-classification,
      weather-climate, demographic-census

  resolution:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: >
      Spatial resolution in human-readable form. For raster, use the
      ground sample distance (e.g., "10m", "30m", "0.6m"). For vector,
      use "feature-level". For tabular, use the aggregation unit
      (e.g., "census-tract", "county").

  coverage:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: >
      Geographic coverage. Be specific about limitations.
      Examples: "global", "CONUS only", "global land surfaces",
      "global but variable completeness"

  key_traits:
    type: string (multiline)
    required: true
    description: >
      2-4 sentences describing what this dataset CAN PERCEIVE or DISTINGUISH.
      Do NOT list specific applications — instead describe the capabilities
      that allow the agent to REASON about applicability.

      Good: "Distinguishes vegetation, water, bare soil, and built surfaces
      at 10m resolution. Multitemporal analysis possible with 5-day revisit.
      Free and open access."

      Bad: "Used for parking lot detection, crop monitoring, flood mapping..."
      (This pre-enumerates uses instead of describing capabilities.)
